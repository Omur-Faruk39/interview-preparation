        <h1>Human Eyes</h1>
        <article>
          The human eye is a highly intricate and essential organ responsible
          for the sense of sight. It enables us to perceive and interpret visual
          information from the environment, allowing us to navigate,
          communicate, and experience the world around us. The eye's structure
          and function are complex, involving several parts that work together
          to capture light and send signals to the brain for interpretation. At
          the front of the eye, the cornea acts as the clear outer covering,
          focusing light that enters the eye. Behind the cornea lies the iris,
          the colored part of the eye, which controls the size of the pupil. The
          pupil adjusts in size to regulate the amount of light entering the
          eye, constricting in bright light and dilating in low light. After
          passing through the pupil, the light reaches the lens, which further
          focuses the light onto the retina, located at the back of the eye. The
          retina is a light-sensitive layer of tissue containing two types of
          photoreceptor cells: rods and cones. Rods are responsible for vision
          in dim light, while cones are responsible for detecting color and fine
          detail in brighter conditions. These photoreceptors convert light into
          electrical signals, which are then transmitted through the optic nerve
          to the brain. The brain processes these signals, enabling us to
          perceive and recognize images. The sclera, the white part of the eye,
          provides structural support and protection. The eye's internal
          fluid-filled chambers—vitreous humor and aqueous humor—help maintain
          the eye's shape and keep its structures nourished. The vitreous humor
          fills the space between the lens and retina, while the aqueous humor
          is found between the cornea and the lens. Both fluids are essential
          for maintaining proper eye pressure and facilitating the passage of
          light. Vision is a dynamic process, as the eye can adapt to varying
          light conditions. In bright environments, the pupil constricts to
          limit the amount of light entering the eye, protecting the retina from
          damage.
